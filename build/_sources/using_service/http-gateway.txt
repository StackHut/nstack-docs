nstack HTTP Gateway
=====================

Once your service has been deployed, you can attach it to the nstack HTTP Gateway. This lets you call your service over HTTP.

Say we have a service which we have deployed called gateway-test:

**TODO:all how do i specify remote vs. local vm?**

.. code-block:: bash
	$ nstack ls | grep gateway-test
	[nstack] gateway-test, leo-anthias, Mon April 29 14:03

I can attach this service to an HTTP Gateway as follows:

.. code-block:: bash
	$ nstack trigger gateway-test http
	[nstack] Success: gateway-test is now available at http://nstack-vm/services/gateway-test

.. Note: by default this exposes all of the functions in your idl file. To expose a single function, you can specify 'function=myFunc'

Now I can call a function via HTTP PUT.

..code-block:: bash
	$ curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -XPUT http://nstack-vm/services/gateway-test -d '{ "method" : "Add", "params" : [1,2] }'
