Advanced Tutorial
******************

In this section, we're going to productionise a Random Forest classifier written with `sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org/>`_, deploy it to the cloud, and use it in a more sophisticated workflow. 

By the end of the tutorial, you will learn how to build modules with dependencies, write more sophisticated workflows, and build abstractions over data-sources. Enjoy!
