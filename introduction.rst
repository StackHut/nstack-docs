Introduction

nstack is a framework to construct, compile, and compose 'algebraic' microservices.

nstack turns a piece of code (such as a function, a class, or a libary) into a lightweight microservice that can be bound to an event-source (such as a stream, a message queue, or a scheduler). On an event, nstack intelligently distributes execution of your service and routes messages into your code.

As a developer, you can focus exclusively on writing your core business-logic, while nstack makes performant, intelligent decisions about your services, and solves many common problems out of the box.
