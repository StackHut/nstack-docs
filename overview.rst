What is NStack?
===============

NStack is a self-service analytics platform which lets teams deploy and productionise data-driven code without writing complex infrastructure or relying on an engineering team. Once your code is on NStack, it can be connected to production systems (such as databases, your data warehouse, HTTP endpoints, or realtime systems) to accomplish sophisticated data-driven tasks in the cloud. This lets teams answers questions more quickly.

What problems does it solve?

Productionising data-driven code

Wanting to write code and use it in with production systems is no longer mutually inclusive with knowing how to build and architect complex infrastructure. NStack lets data teams productionise their code in the cloud and hook it up to other systems, without complex engineering.
